A brief description of the pull request.


## Known issues / Notes

If you found any issues while developing the feature, this is the place where you should detail everything.
Also you can report bugs found or any missing functionality.


## Screenshots or Screencasts

If your code modifies front end views, then you should attach screenshots for every modification.
You should add a screenshot of the original design and your implementation, for various devices or browsers.

If you need to record a video (or gif) to show a change in flow or animations:
- you can use [LICECap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for OSX
- you can check [this](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CreatingScreencasts) for Ubuntu to add animated gifs to your pull request to show some transitions between views
- you can use QuickTime to record from device (if you need to test on device because of bluetooth use for example). Check [this](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/record-iphone-screen-quicktime/) tutorial on how to record a screencast with Quicktime and then check [this](https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207) tutorial on how to convert the `.mov` to `.gif` file in order to be able to attach it to the pull request.


## Test Plan

You should add here any necessary information for being able to run the new code (any migrations needed or scripts to run).

Then you should add at least one test plan:

* Open the app
* Login with username 'test@gmail.com' password '123456'
* You should see a tost with spinner while logging in.
* The main tab bar view should appear after a successfull login.


## Others ...

You could add any other section you may need, like _Discussion_ for example.
